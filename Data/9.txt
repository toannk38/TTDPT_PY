Let’s get straight to the money quote. Dolly Parton, she of legendary country music fame, might be ruffling a few feathers with this quote from Billboard’s Country Power Players 2020 cover story :
And of course, Black lives matter. Do we think our little white asses are the only ones that matter? No!

The star talks about a lot in this interview, which you can read here. Interestingly she delves into why she removed the name Dixie from use in her Dollywood theme park back in 2018. It was a business decision, she says. She doesn’t want to offend anybody. And, personally, as a Black person who has visited Dollywood, I certainly appreciate her ability to recognize a problem and fix it without a lot of public hemming and hawing.
Her decision makes a lot of sense from a business standpoint as Parton, 74, is rich for a reason. She’s savvy. She’s sold millions of records, has a slew of top 10 hits, and is still creating. This October she is releasing (yet another) holiday album, she’s managing her legacy, and she is mindfully trying to manage through Covid-19 at her Dollywood theme park. Words are never enough — actions are what matters — but Parton’s perfunctory discussion of the matter without using the typical “whataboutisms” used by many others is singularly refreshing.
